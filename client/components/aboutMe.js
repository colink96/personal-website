          <p>
            My name is Colin Kim and I am a full-stack software engineer and
            competitive bboy (breakdancer) based in New York City.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from NYU Stern in May 2019 with a B.A. in Business, with
            concentrations in both Data Science and Finance. During my last year
            of college I quickly realized that I was passionate for tech, but
            felt that data science only scratched the surface of the types of
            projects I wanted to work on. Shortly after graduating from NYU, I
            made the leap of faith to pivot my career and enrolled in Fullstack
            Academy's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp where I was able
            develop the skills I needed to pursue this newfound passion.

            I am now looking for opportunities to work in a collaborative team
            environment with interesting projects through which I can grow and
            further develop my skills.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some of the technologies I have been working with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>Express</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL</li>
            <li>Sequelize</li>
            <li>React/React Native</li>
            <li>ViroReact</li>
            <li>Redux</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>Socket.io</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
